# Detroit-Crime-Visualization

Detroit is the largest city in the midwestern state of Michigan. Here I am exploring the Crime details since January 2009.
Cleaning of the data is done using R in Rstudio
Additional weather data is added to the original data to get a better visualization of the situation
All the visualization is done using Tableau. Link given below:
